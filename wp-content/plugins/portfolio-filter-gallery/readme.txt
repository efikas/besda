**PORTFOLIO FILTER GALLERY DESIGN**

Portfolio gallery method is really easy to use you will find a separate category page, the user can easily create a portfolio within a minute. choose the filters with the images with a select box
that makes a really different portfolio filter gallery with other plugins. Show portfolio with or without a lightbox, in the free version of the portfolio you have a bootstrap lightbox with navigation.
you can also show title with images and the title will also appear with bootstrap lightbox in the bottom. If you don't want lightbox you can also link your portfolio for an external project.
The default layout of the portfolio is the masonry layout. If you want to use the grid layout you can use the same size image for the portfolio. then you can show your portfolio with grid layout also.
Show your portfolio gallery with a border or you can show your portfolio without spacing or with spacing.

**DEFINING MASONRY LAYOUT IN PORTFOLIO**
The term Masonry layout probably owes its name to the popular jQuery Masonry plugin that is used to generate this type of layout. 
Masonry layout is also referred to as the Pinterest Style Layout, as www.pinterest.com was the first major website to use this layout style. Masonry layout gives a great look of your portfolio gallery
The plugins listed contain unique features in addition to the common feature set. It is difficult to understand the difference between each plugin just by looking at a Masonry layout generated by each one. All of the layouts will appear quite similar. It is important to consider the available features before choosing a plugin. Generally, most plugins provide an API and documentation for identifying their features.
I suggest looking at the available features of each plugin before making your choice. I have compiled the following list of common features from the plugins listed in the previous section. These are some of the main features, but each plugin also has its own unique ones. It’s up to you to choose the best plugin based on your application requirements.
Masonry layouts can have fixed-size columns or dynamic columns. Fixed-size columns are the norm. It is better to choose a plugin that allows dynamic columns, as it enhances flexibility.
Sorting and Filtering – Plugins like Isotope allow you to sort and filter the elements without losing the structure of the layout. It is a good feature to have when you need dynamic Masonry layouts.
Animation – Unlike normal layouts, Masonry layouts change completely with the addition or removal of elements. Because of this, it is better to have animation effects for adjusting elements – this creates an awesome user experience.
Dynamic Elements – Generally, we create the layout on page load using the available elements. But some sites might require the ability to add or remove elements without refreshing. In such cases, the plugin should have the ability to auto adjust the layout to provide the optimal structure.
Layout Options – The plugin should allow you to set column width, gutter size, alignment, etc.
Developers and designers are accustomed to seeing web pages laid out with CSS floats. But this common type of layout doesn’t take the size of the elements into consideration. Instead, it adds elements one after another, first in the horizontal direction, then vertically.

**(PORTFOLIO ) CUSTOM CSS OPTION**
Custom CSS is part of Custom Design, which is a feature of the WordPress.com Premium and WordPress.com Business plans. … CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a markup language that controls the appearance of HTML elements on a web page.

**(PORTFOLIO ) LINK OPTION**
Link portfolio by giving a link on separate images
